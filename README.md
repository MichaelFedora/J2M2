# J2M2
Markdown to Jira / Jira to Markdown conversion tool

Stripped down version of [FokkeZB's J2M](https://github.com/FokkeZB/J2M), intended purely to run as a tiny web-based conversion tool (no fancy `npm` / command line usage etc).

Extended from the original to support a few extra markdown quirks. See [commit history](https://github.com/patrickhlauke/J2M2/commits/gh-pages) for details.
